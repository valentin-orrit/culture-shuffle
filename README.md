# Culture Shuffle

Culture quiz application made with React, using the Open Trivia API to offer questions about music, cinema, classical arts, and literature.

Adapted from a final exercise of the React training from [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/), this application is my first attempt at creating a React app from scratch. This app has no backend, and I used React Router for routing.

The app has three pages:

-   a Home page where users can choose a category (which modifies the API request to Open Trivia)
-   a Questions page where questions are displayed one by one
-   a Results page that shows the user's answers and the correct answers. _Thereâ€™s even a little surprise for users who achieve a perfect score!_
